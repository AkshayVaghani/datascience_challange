I don't mind paying what i owe for the phones, but i don't think it should be that much monthly, especially with the discount. Those smart talk. Phones that i don't want seem to be much cheaper. Ok is that with the discount for my employer. Ok, when will the phones be paid in full, if i just pay monthly, how much would the monthly bill be if I had phones paid ok.?

You mean, if there's two people already on our account, who both want to upgrade one i have to pay for, and one is free.

Now, If she tried to upgrade her phone, would she have to pay full price for a phone? She is a teenager, hence my question before, but she is in the system with no parental help, so I'm trying to help her I'm talking about her being on the pay, as you gl plab, But she's only 16, so she won't be able to pull it off Onto her own accoutn anyways at that time, but will there be a balance owed on the free phone? What are the 2 monthly payments? Then the phone is free, no catch. Is there a 24 month committment to the phone number line or something, but will there be a balance owed for the phone? She will need to start a new phone number, but the new phone would be attached to a new number or that number. So if I upgrade my phone I will get a new iphone 8 and I have to start a new phone number/line on our account. I have to keep it for 2 months.
