We are currently seeking to fill the position of Junior Professional Officer, at the P2 level, for Systems Engineering with a thematic focus on digital systems development, integration, rollout and field support, based in the Market Access Programme Unit of the Policy and Programme Division of WFP Rome Headquarters, Italy. CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND As one of the global leaders in Cash-Based Transfers (CBT), in 2016 WFP delivered the largest portion of all of the cash-based transfer humanitarian assistance globally (a total of US$880 million); and scaled-up further in 2017 by delivering an estimated US$1.4 billion to beneficiaries.  To deliver CBT assistance, WFP works through partnerships with more than 70 commercial Financial Service Providers (FSPs) including banks, micro-finance institutions, mobile money operators and money transfer agents, in addition to using WFP’s own delivery platform SCOPE. Due to the magnitude of WFP’s CBT transfers, and its reliance on partnerships with external service providers for transferring funds, it is a priority for the Organization to ensure the robustness and inter-operability of its digital systems in order to ensure accountability for funds as well as to better inform programme design through digital analysis of data emanating from CBT operations.  The overarching objective of WFP’s digital systems development is to deliver better and more accountable CBT assistance while also supporting partners (including governments) to build or optimize their own systems to ensure that long-term sustainable support and social protection is available for WFP’s beneficiaries. WFP intends to “digitally know” its beneficiaries and their needs and preferences and the impact of projects and operations over time on families and local sectors (i.e. financial, markets, etc.). This knowledge will be possible only with a safe, seamless, perpetual flow of data and information between all departments, divisions, units, and teams across WFP and its partners. It will need to be enabled by the latest proven technologies, systems, and processes to gather, organize, share, analyze, and transform data into knowledge and evidence for responsible and informed programmatic decision making.  WFP is seeking the support of a JPO with skills in Computer Systems Engineering to help design, integrate and optimize aspects of WFP’s corporate digital systems used for digital transfer, payment cycle reconciliation and comprehensive data analysis. Following the systems development phase, the JPO will be involved in coordinating and supporting the rollout of new digital systems in WFP operations in the field worldwide.
