At ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.  As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we’re delivering the best possible solution.  We believe that to flourish as a Full Stack Software Developer here, you will have the following competencies: Technical SkillsCore blockchain concepts. Blockchain is a new field of technology that is rapidly evolving. If you are not yet fully immersed in the technology, you should be willing to dive deep down the rabbit hole. Therefore, it would be beneficial if you already have experience or awareness of Ethereum, Solidity, Truffle, Infura, Geth, Parity, Quorum, or other blockchain platforms and technologies.Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.Coding. Our clients don’t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a Full Stack Developer, we’re looking for a breadth of experience in multiple languages, and proven expertise in one or two:We would especially like to hear from you if you are strong in Java, Python, Haskell, Golang, or maybe also JavaScript/React.JS.You should be comfortable with Rapid Application Development, and be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.Cloud deployments. Experience building for deployments to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc. using Docker would be helpful. If you're also comfortable with distributed systems and technologies, great!Prototyping and PoCs. You'll have experience of building prototypes for different use cases, and won't get too worried if needs and priorities change, meaning that they don't end up being implemented.Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients to great success. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.Soft SkillsSharing knowledge. Working together with the rest of the team to help each other get up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, especially in such a rapidly changing space.Thinking big and acting fast. You’ll need a startup mentality, and will revel in rapidly switching between different projects, priorities and contexts. Being ready and able to pivot or adjust plans quickly is one of your strengths.Open minded and flexible. Your role as a Full Stack Developer won't be set in stone, so it's vital that you enjoy change and you're willing to experience new ways of thinking and working with the ConsenSys teams. Sense of humour is a plus!And here are some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.A dynamic startup environment. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization.Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users.

Our mission is to help banks become truly digital so that billions of people can get access to amazing financial services that look after them rather than benefitting from their mistakes.  Our team has co-founded and created challenger banks (Monzo, Starling, Tandem), delivered banking interfaces that millions of people use, developed real world blockchain projects, worked on APIs for financial inclusion in Africa, and we are helping banks and fintechs think differently across the world.

We know that building high performance, highly scalable, always available, fault tolerant systems is a team game and so we want to know that you play well with others. Lone geniuses are brilliant - just not for us.  We strongly believe that you grow a system, rather than build it, so our architecture and infrastructure is designed to allow us to roll small bits of code to production really fast. And really often. At a minimum we want to see that you have experience of working in cloud based, continuous deployment type environments and that you can demonstrate that you understand that with this awesome power comes a lot of responsibility to make sure you are doing things right. We are mainly interested in making sure you have the right behaviours by default but we would also love to see you have good experience of using schedulers like Kubernetes, Mesos/Marathon and containers like Docker.  Language wise, we don’t believe that there is one ring to rule them all and so we definitely want to choose the right tool for the right job. That doesn’t mean that it is a free for all and that anything goes, but we are looking for people who are comfortable with several languages and paradigms. If you speak functional AND OO then we definitely want to talk to you. Our back end services typically run either JVM (Java, Scala, Clojure) based languages, Go or something like Python/R for the analytics streams. For the front end we are React orientated and the mobile teams are native Android and IOS. The more languages and paradigms you are fluent in, the more we will probably like you!  Finally, we know you get this, but guarantee your place on the team and make yourself stand out by telling us all about all those “character building” experiences you have gained through having to live with the systems that you have built. Show us your battle scars and explain to us what operational insights and learnings you have gained by having to trouble shoot issues at some horrible time in the morning and what you put in place to make sure that particular issue didn’t bite you again. Expect us to ask about how you trouble shoot issues and demonstrate, with actions, that you understand that ops and quality assurance is EVERYONE’s job and not someone else’s’. If you build it, you will run it so do a good job!BenefitsSimple, build a banking platform which will improve the lives of millions of business people.

At ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.  As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we’re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Developer plays an important role in leading these projects to success. Curious what makes a Lead Developer within ConsenSys? A lead is: Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery You will be excited to coach, mentor, influence and lead a team of ConsenSys employees as well as engage and advise clients. An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more (still willing and able to dive into the code if required) Owner of the technical recommendations to the client - both on technology/tool choices as well as architecture We believe that to flourish as a Lead Developer here, you have the following competencies:: Technical SkillsCore blockchain concepts. Blockchain is a new field of technology that is rapidly evolving. If you are not yet fully immersed in the technology, you should be willing to dive deep down the rabbit hole. Therefore, it would be beneficial (but not a mandatory requirement) if you already have experience or awareness of Ethereum, Solidity, Bytecode, Truffle, Infura, Geth, Parity, Quorum, or other blockchain platforms and technologies.Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it’s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don’t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a Lead Developer, we’re looking for a breadth of experience in multiple languages, and proven expertise in one or two:  Javascript is high on our list, especially React.JS. Other notables include Python, Java, Haskell, Golang. You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.Cloud deployments. Experience building for deployments to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc. using Docker would be helpful. If you're also comfortable with distributed systems and technologies, great!Consulting and delivery. Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again.Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients to great success. As well as having previous experience of managing software development teams, you should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.Soft SkillsCoaching and mentoring. As an experienced team manager, you will be naturally inclined to share knowledge with others to bring them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you’ll bring to the table, you’ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.Thinking big and acting fast. You’ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you’re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations’ tech strategies.Influencing skills & prioritisation. This goes for for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you’re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client’s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you’ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. Managing client expectations and ensuring the team meets deadlines is critical.Subject Matter Expert. Be able to participate in a sales pitch while providing the rest of the sales team with a strong understanding of the proposed target solution.Open minded and flexible. Your role as a Lead Developer won't be set in stone, so it's vital that you enjoy change and you're willing to experience new ways of thinking and working with the ConsenSys teams. Sense of humor is a plus.And here are some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.A dynamic startup environment. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization.Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. ConsenSys is building the technology platforms that can get us to those next thresholds of scale. ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators reportA few important things to knowTravel is required. Projects may be on customer sites, so our blockchain consultants need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Many of our consultants travel for weeks on end. We do our best to take people’s personal situations into account, but we know it’s not for everyone.Residing near our European HQ in London is required.

For more information, please visit us at https://jobs.gartner.com/ Job Description The Research Director will create a body of technology focused Gartner research, analysis, and advice for end user clients. This will be communicated to clients via published research and compelling interactions. In addition, this body of research will support the sales force in sales and retention activities.  The body of research is aimed at providing insight, predictions and actionable advice to clients relating to Financial IT Systems particularly as related to the support for client’s Postmodern ERP strategies. These systems would include the following functionality: general ledger; finance planning, budgeting, and forecasting; accounts receivable; fixed assets; project accounting; invoicing; and revenue recognition.  Of particular importance is the ability to present this research in a way that engages senior Finance IT leaders, ERP leaders and also the CIO. Cloud deployment options and benefits realization are two areas of high interest. Key responsibilities are: Create and maintain multiple thought leading research documents by evaluating products, solutions, trends and results; interviewing clients, vendors, and industry experts, and writing compelling and actionable research which is then published on gartner.com.Provide individualized advice for both end-user as well as vendor clients regarding Gartner research through compelling and actionable 30-minute video based interactions (inquiries).Prepare and deliver one or more content presentation(s) at one or more of the company's conferences, and perform tasks to support conferences, such as client 1:1 meetings.Provides on-site client and vendor strategic advisory services to senior executives as requested.Contribute to the team’s success through agenda planning and development by participating in planning meetings and completing action items and assignments given.Remain current on developments and issues within the area of finance IT systems and the needs of the CFO’s office.

Understanding how these systems form a part of the postmodern ERP and the interplay between modernising finance systems and modernising back-office operational systems (or ERP) is a must.  The successful candidate is required to understand how this market is developing, what new technologies will change the market in the next five years, how users will consume the developed functionality, and what the vendor landscape will look like.  This understanding must also translate from the tactical knowledge of these aspects into the strategic aspects that enterprises must consider to realize the value of such a key enterprise asset that business as well as technology leaders can act on. The need for and the impact of change and change leadership are other key elements that the role must address.  An ability to understand the impact of Cloud (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), In Memory Computing (IMC,) the impact of the Internet of Things (Iot) and other Digital Business technologies and how they can help transform financial processes is required. The successful candidate must have led user organization initiatives, for example, responsibility for finance IT systems strategy.  The candidate must have a good understanding of the business needs driving this market not just IT program/project/implementation experience.

Its flagship service is BankchainTM, a next-generation blockchain settlement platform that is transforming post-trade across capital markets. Paxos management team is led by CEO and Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla and its board of directors includes former FDIC chair Sheila Bair, former Senator Bill Bradley, former chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Robert Herz, former chairman, president & CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi and former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer. We pride ourselves on a very high hiring bar which is why instead of a standard job description, we think of our roles first and foremost in terms of the outcomes they are meant to achieve. So we have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections.We hope you will enjoy reading this as much as we enjoyed writing it. Outcomes: Outcomes are meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and the business over a defined timeframe. How to Achieve Outcomes: We also have a strong point of view on how someone in that role could succeed in achieving those outcomes and, eventually, at Paxos. So we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role.Outcomes Produces a work output by taking a complex user story, breaking it down into sub-tasks, and completing the sub-tasks with relative ease - own design, coding, testing all the way through deployment of each of those sub-tasks. Identifies and proactively tackles technical debt before it grows into something that requires significant up-front work to resolve. A rule of thumb is to start looking into root cause of issues whenever there is noise. There is no smoke without fire. Strike the right balance between fixing the problem at hand and focusing on finding the root cause of problem. For example, if its a production issue the priority is to fix the immediate problem and collect all the data necessary for root cause analysis. In a non-production environment, the focus should be on finding the root cause and fixing it the right way to make sure the problem doesnt occur again. Active involvement and mentorship of junior engineers doing code reviews resulting in up leveling the skill sets for the entire teamHow to Achieve the OutcomesTechnical Acumen Required: A rock solid engineer who is master of at least one domain. This could be a functional domain like Securities or Precious Metals or a technical domain like Distributed Systems, Cryptography, Databases, AWS, etc. Able to understand and articulate the design and application of the architecture of the entire systemAccountability: Communicates effectively, consistently and in a timely fashion, across functions and is able to work well with the Product, UX and Solutions teams. Proactively identifies problems with requirements (lack of clarity, inconsistencies, technical limitations) for their own work and adjacent work, and communicate these issues early to help course-correct.Take Initiative: Takes the initiative to identify and solve important problems even if they are in their domain or work area because of the ability to spot problems downstream and work with others to fix them before they become fires. Shows initiative beyond merely knocking tasks off a list. Identifies and suggests areas of future work for themselves and their teams.Be a Force Multiplier: Able to work independently with very little oversight beyond high-level direction Participates extensively in code reviews, mentors others via code reviews and pairing, document thoroughly as well as frequently presenting at team meetingsKeep it Simple and Smart: Understands the tradeoffs needed in creating good software in their area, which is often times an entire product or platform featureRespect Everyone: Able to communicate effectively across functions. The ability to get work done across teams goes beyond mere proactive status updates (although that is expected as well) Play a leadership role in making the right trade-offs with other teams even when doing so might mean more work for themselves, as long as that is the right thing to do.Paxos is an equal opportunity employer.

You would take a lead on ensuring that the theoretical fault tolerance of our EVM-based blockchain Hyperledger Burrow translates to robustness in a practical sense - by understanding the issues of operability, maintenance, human error, and unfortunate or worst-case events. Our consensus mechanism Tendermint has integrity and authenticity of data baked in at its core - but the technology is still immature. As we move to launch our Agreements Network (see below) we need to ensure we mitigate failure risks, minimize blast radius, build appropriate circuit breakers, and have second and third line disaster recovery plans for our platform. Since we are dealing with representing real value on our platform we need to be able to maintain correctness, even if that means stopping the world, reverting state, and providing manual resolution in the worst case. In our master-less architecture providing these guarantees is made harder and requires careful consideration.  Although some of our systems are new we believe in a heterogeneous cloud where traditional systems integrate with decentralised ones. Blockchains and decentralised storage systems are closely related to existing distributed databases and object stores. The focus of your role will be around our Kubernetes-based deployment and blending blockchain-land with more traditional (and battle-tested) DevOps and cloud tooling. We see integration between these two worlds as critical to our success and issues such as message queuing, API management, caching, logging, and metrics are all key to that goal.  You would be officially part of the Platform team but your role will be one of the most wide-ranging in the company across all of our teams - platform, legal engineering, smart contract development, and product. All of the components that make up the Agreements Network need the ability to fail gracefully - and then recover.  You will also have the opportunity to write core code for the platform in support of your reliability engineering role. What do we think we need? Someone who: A competent developer who can read Go, Javascript (NodeJS and frontend), Solidity (EVM code), and shell scripts within the first few weeksHas a non-trivial understanding of cloud native tooling such as Kubernetes, Helm, Elasticsearch, and Prometheus.Has basic working knowledge of AWS and GCE.Has at least two years worth of multi-server non-trivial cloud deployments - ideally with containersWho can continuously improve and refine our processes - deployment, CI, testing - without promptingWho can plan, re-prioritise, and switch contexts with ease - creating just enough documentation so others have visibilityCan help the team avoid mistakes by positively challenging possible misstepsCan pinpoint cross-team reliability issues and take responsibility for things not 'falling between the gaps'Can interact with different teams with empathy to understand why reliability or correctness issues exist and how to help resolve themPromotes collective responsibility and breaks down siloed thinking by making things their problem Of particular importance is that you are able to take part in a forceful yet respectful technical argument with colleagues, that you are able to change your mind about something, and to change other’s minds. About Monax Monax were pioneers of permissioned ledgers and smart contracts and now we are building a legal agreements network to allow new and more efficient forms of legal transacting, exploiting the benefits of various decentralised, distributed, and masterless technologies.  Monax would like to build a better system for contracting for the good of humanity and other forms of life. In particular we would like to: Harness lawyers and lawyering in a way that lowers rental and intermediary costs in the market (e.g. having to run a law firm or requiring an audit to understand in-flight agreement processes) while also enabling lawyers to “productize” their previously bespoke servicesLaunch decentralised networks on which to record and interact with agreements that can be operated by all parties on an equal footing.Automate paper-based legal processes and document tennis between parties.Allow the decentralised networks to execute elements of agreement process acting as a virtual trusted intermediary.Who will you be working with? We are approximately ten people, so to some extent everyone, but most closely with the platform team. This will consist of: Monax’s CTO -- who will be your direct supervisorMonax's CEO who has taken the lead role in developing our cloud deployment so far and based in Edinburgh and with whom you will have a close working relationshipOther new team members more focussed on core platform codeThree full-time developers from Tata Consulting Services who are partnering with us to work on BurrowExtra help on demand from 1-2 freelance developersContributors from Hyperledger community including IBM and Intel from the Fabric and Sawtooth Lake projects collaborating on our EVMWhat can the job offer?Helping blockchain systems live up to some of their hype by making them highly operable - our network will ultimately be operated by many parties and this needs to be as painless as possibleExperience in blending together distributed, decentralised, and centralised systemsExtremely marketable blockchain and cryptocurrencies skills.Opportunity to spend time working on something foundational at the level of a network architecture - something that is worth time spent finely honing.Building a genuinely novel system that in part intends to create an entirely new market.Spend time thinking ‘around the software’; about law, economics, and game theory.Flexible working - we have regular discussions online and we want more time spent in the same room within teams - but outside this pick your hours and place of work (we have workspace Edinburgh).High level of autonomy and just enough hierarchy - consensus and individual project responsibility (c.f. design-by-committee) favoured over diktats.Real examples of things you might work on For Burrow we have a full, public roadmap of things to deliver in Q1.  Some things the platform team has been doing in the last three months: Attending a Hyperledger hackfest in LisbonDiagnosing a bug deep in the concurrent list implementation used by our consensus engine based on an unsafe/pointer and Go’s memory layoutImplementing a simple stack-based language for building logging pipelinesRefactoring a few thousands lines of Burrow (https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/666)Researching a tool for generating petri-nets from BPMN processesAssisting with an academic project looking into voting on the blockchain: http://volt-project.org/ Some projects requiring near-term attention: Deploy and run IPFS nodes with pinningImplement our key signing interface against a cloud based hardware security modelProvide additional security features for validators joining the networkWork out how to perform network initialisation - public key gossip and PKIDevelop in cluster monitoring and automatic failover for blockchain nodes which have fallen out of consensus or are no longer connected into their peers.

Part of that change has come from Axiom’s Talent Platform, which was built on the premise that the client and the business model should not, could not, remain at odds. Today we serve the largest organizations at their most critical times meeting their most critical needs. The lives of over 1,000 attorneys are better for it.  After people, came technology, industrialization and a consulting mindset – to unlock change in the commercial contracts space that comes with scale. M&A diligence and integration, Regulatory Response, Clinical Trial Acceleration, and High-Performance Contracting. These are team-based legal and contract solutions. Most are project/consultative-based (3-12 months in duration) and some are long-term outsourcing deals (2-4 year terms). Under either construct, Axiom is accountable for delivering outcomes historically performed by traditional law firms or large in-house legal teams. As such, our clients are the most sophisticated buyers of legal services in the world – names you will know. They expect excellence and they expect us to lead them.  We call this our Contracts Platform.  Started only a few years ago, the Contracts Platform now employs over 1,000 people, many of whom are permanent, though we have built and leverage a large network of on-demand talent to economically handle the spiky nature of our business. Most of the staff are legally trained, working alongside technologists, program managers, and business analysts, spread across the globe in one of our three Centers of Excellence (Chicago, NY, Belfast, NI, and Wroclaw, Poland), or on client sites in New York, London, and the North Carolina Research Triangle.  We have exciting products in the market that are getting strong uptake. This is the fastest growing part of our business and represents one-third of our revenue. And the potential is massive. The industry is ripe for change – driven by technology – the momentum is undeniable. Due to our deep client base, and existing strong relationships with the channel, we have a truly unique opportunity to move an entire industry from artisanal to industrial to digital. We’ve already begun and have made strong process. And now we get to explore and apply the most significant technology available (e.g., artificial intelligence, blockchain), building unique capabilities to derive client value like no other organization can.  You will be a core part of driving that journey as your number one responsibility is our clients’ satisfaction in how they experience our services. Our clients are our life blood – without their delight, we’re not achieving our mission. Without their delight, we’re not meeting our promises to ourselves and our shareholders. Without their delight, we are deprived of the oxygen we need to move forward.  You and your team will need client problem solvers at our core. You will build, lead and inspire a team who brings intensity, a deep caring for our clients, and a consultative and problem-solving mindset to each engagement, looking around corners, bringing issues and resolutions to clients before they even realize there’s a problem!  Working in conjunction with our product and CTO team, you will embrace, contribute and evangelize the leveraging of technology (e.g., artificial intelligence, robotics) to make our teams more efficient – even if it ultimately means our teams become smaller as technology takes over more routine tasks.
